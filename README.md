This is a sample CI/CD pipeline that demonstrates how to build a Docker image and deploy it to Google Cloud Platform using Terraform. The pipeline is triggered by a push to the main branch and runs on an ubuntu-latest machine.

Environment Variables
This pipeline uses the following environment variables:

GCP_PROJECT_ID: the ID of the Google Cloud Platform project to deploy the application to
TF_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS: the credentials file for Google Cloud Platform, in JSON format
Pipeline Steps
The pipeline consists of the following steps:

Checkout repository
Build Docker image
Set up Terraform
Run Terraform plan
Scaling and Delivering Content
To scale and deliver the content to a larger audience, one possible solution is to use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes to manage and scale the Docker containers. Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of containers based on the traffic and resource usage of the application.

Hosting and Scaling
In the implemented solution, the application is hosted on Google Cloud Platform using a Kubernetes cluster. The cluster is set up using Terraform, which automates the deployment of the infrastructure.

To scale the application, the Kubernetes cluster can be configured to automatically provision additional resources like virtual machines or containers based on the demand. This can be done using auto-scaling groups.

Explanation of Choices
Docker: Docker is used to package the application and its dependencies into a portable container. Containers provide consistency and reproducibility across different environments, making it easier to deploy the application to different platforms.

Google Cloud Platform: Google Cloud Platform is used to host and deploy the application. GCP provides a wide range of services that can be used to build, deploy, and manage applications, including Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Run, and App Engine. In the implemented solution, a Kubernetes cluster is used to manage the Docker containers.

Terraform: Terraform is used to automate the deployment of the infrastructure on GCP. Terraform provides a declarative syntax for defining infrastructure as code, making it easier to manage and version control the infrastructure.

GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions is used to orchestrate the CI/CD pipeline. GitHub Actions provides a flexible and customizable platform for building and deploying applications, with support for many popular tools and services. In the implemented solution, GitHub Actions is used to trigger the pipeline on a push to the main branch, build the Docker image, and deploy the application to GCP using Terraform.
